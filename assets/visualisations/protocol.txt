clean_data_vehicle_crashes:
    created separate dataset with corrected values (eg. TAXI and taxi made the same)
    removed uninformative info. (eg. nan, 80, 1, unknown)
    made bar graph to check

nyc_motor_vehicloe_crashes:
    imoprted data
    created a road using function
    experimented different vizulisations

weather_data:
    imported weather data corelated to the crashes (some dates didn't cvorelate so we got the union)
    experimented with visulizations
    checked for correlation with weather conditions


visulization protocols with tableau:
    Protocol: types of cars:
    1. included in marks: vehicle code by shape and color
    2. filters: vehicle type and borough

    Protocol holiday crashes:
    1. columns: crash time by hour
    2. rows: count of collisions
    3. filters: "calculation 1" includes famous holidays

    Protocol crash by district:
    1. rows & columns: longitude and latitude on map
    2. Marks: count collisions (color graded) by zip code
    3. Filters: filtered by borough

    Protocol crashes by years:
    1. columns: crashes by year
    2. rows: count crashes by collision id
    3.filter: filtered by crash year

    protocol crashes by month:
    1. columns: crash date by month
    2. rows: count crashes with collision id
    3. filters: filter by year

    protocol crashes each day of th emonth:
    1. columns: crash date by day
    2. rows: count crash collision id
    3. filters: filter xcrashes by year
